# rundot-blinks-ggj20201

> Its like minesweeper, but the theres just one mine, and the mine moves

* Reprogram the blinks before each game (because I haven't written reset code yet)
* Remove 1 (and only 1!) blink from the group and single tap it
  * It will become read (later on it wont stay red I promise)
* Physically shuffle up all the blinks
* Join them back together and press any one of them
* Now press any one of them to start the game
* the blinks will all light up showing the path to the mine
    * later they wont all show the path, just the last one you pressed
* tap a blink to "sweep it"
* the mine will then move if it can and everyone will update their paths
*keep on sweeping until the mine can't move
