# Sleuth

> The ROOK GANG is fleeing GAMBIT MANOR with the precious BISHOP SAPPHIRE in tow! Follow their trail, corner the thieves, but don't get caught unawares in pursuit.

## Overview

* Players: 1
* Blinks Required: 6
* Blinks Recommended: 12+

## Instructions

### Setting the Stage

* Build the alleys and streets of the city you'll be chasing the ROOK GANG through by joining all your blinks into a connected field and then **long press** one of them until the city blinks white.
* **Double tap** any of the blinks to randomly place the ROOK GANG. The blinks will spin white while they figure this out and then pulse blue once the ROOK GANG is in place.

### Let the Chase Begin

* **Double Tap** any un-searched (blue) blink to investigate a city street.
* Blink under investigation will spin blue in anticipation.
* If the ROOK GANG gets the drop on you (you clicked on the Gang's blink directly), you loose!. The Gang's renown  will spiral outward (in red) throughout the whole city.
  * Take a deep breath, focus, and **long press** any blink to start over
* If the blink under investigation was clear, it will point in the direction of the ROOK GANG
  * The face nearest the ROOK GANG will turn yellow (the rest green)
  * If two faces are equally distant, they will both turn yellow
* Repeat these steps until you either win by cornering the ROOK GANG or loose by tapping on them directly.

### ROOK GANG on the Run

* Every time you investigate a blink, if the ROOK GANG can, it will always move to the next street (connected blink)
  * They cannot move to a street you have investigated.
  * The last blink investigated always points to their new location
* Every time you investigate a new street, the last street investigated (that one that was pointing to the Gang) will stop. But remain locked off, preventing the ROOK GANG's return.

### No where to hide

If, after investigating a street, the ROOK GANG has no where to run to, its trapped! You Win! The city is safe once again! (blinks will spin green in celebration). **Long press** any blink to start over and begin the chase anew.

## Difficulty / Game Modes

* While setting things up (the city is pulsing white), triple click a blink to change the game mode.
  * One red face indicates hard mode: Blinks pointing to the gang will lie with two faces if only one face would have been flagged.
  * Two red faces indicates easy (debug) mode: The gang lights up in red and all blocks always point them out.
  * No red faces indicates normal mode.
